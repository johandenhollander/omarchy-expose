Run `./tests/check-theme-runtime` to exercise the installed Omarchy theme APIs
with Exposé's actual settings view, window card, and shared control components.
Pass an output directory to save two rendered PNGs. The test uses an offscreen
Quickshell process with a mock application controller; theme changes affect that
process only. Live window capture is unavailable offscreen, so Quickshell reports
expected Wayland/buffer-backend warnings.

Coverage includes state-specific zero borders, asymmetric widths, side overrides,
gradients, alpha, control fill, radius, typography, spacing, and live theme changes.
After switching to the borderless theme it checks every instantiated settings
border surface, including inactive settings categories.

The theme audit used Omarchy source at `31bd80daa4613ffdee995ac27467fce5a2990806`:

- [Border.qml](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/blob/31bd80daa4613ffdee995ac27467fce5a2990806/shell/Commons/Border.qml)
  owns control and surface colors, alpha, gradients, and per-side width resolution.
- [BorderSurface.qml](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/blob/31bd80daa4613ffdee995ac27467fce5a2990806/shell/Ui/BorderSurface.qml)
  selects the native border or Shape renderer without flattening the theme spec.
- [Style.qml](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/blob/31bd80daa4613ffdee995ac27467fce5a2990806/shell/Commons/Style.qml)
  defines control states, fills, typography, spacing, and corner geometry.
- [Color.qml](https://github.com/omacom/omarchy/blob/31bd80daa4613ffdee995ac27467fce5a2990806/shell/Commons/Color.qml)
  layers user theme overrides and provides menu background/text/scrim roles.

Window cards read the live compositor's `general:border_size` and active/inactive
border gradients with a read-only `hyprctl` batch. The active window, mouse hover,
and keyboard selection use the active gradient; other cards use the inactive one.
Compositor reloads and opening the overview refresh the snapshot. This preserves
window widths and alpha independently of `[controls]`, whose selected border is
commonly zero even when desktop windows have visible borders.

The runtime check covers packed ARGB conversion, transparent colors, gradients,
active/inactive selection, malformed queries, zero compositor width, and live
width/color changes. Settings controls still use focus, hover, selected, and
normal states. Dialog/search surfaces use menu border specs. No state forces a
border when its own width or alpha is zero. Slider tracks and handles remain
value geometry rather than borrowing border widths for their dimensions.

The audit preserves Exposé's blur/dim behavior and animation controls. Other
remaining numeric opacity values express secondary text, disabled controls, or
Quick Look transitions; there are no corresponding shell theme tokens. The black
preview mask is an invisible alpha mask, not a surface color. Inner corner radii
subtract padding and stop at zero, so a square theme stays square.
